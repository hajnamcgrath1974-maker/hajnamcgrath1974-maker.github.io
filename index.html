<h2>About</h2>
<p>I am a Hungarian PhD candidate in Linguistics at Maynooth University, Ireland. Originally from Budapest and now based in Ireland, my academic work is shaped by an interdisciplinary background in Anthropology and Linguistic Anthropology.</p>
<p>My research interests lie at the intersection of minority language communities, linguistic landscape, vocabulary change, language revitalization, language policy, and linguistic human rights. I am particularly interested in dialectal variation and lexical transformation in minoritized language contexts.</p>

<h2>Research</h2>
<p><strong>An Ethnography of Gascon Béarnais Occitan: Language Ideology, Cultural Reclamation, and Whistled Practices</strong></p>
<p>My doctoral research is an ethnographic study of Gascon Béarnais Occitan conducted in Pau and the village of Aas in southern France. The project examines contemporary efforts to sustain and reclaim the dialect, with particular attention to language ideology, authenticity, and revitalization practices.</p>
<p>It explores how activists, educators, institutional actors, and community members engage with both the spoken dialect and its distinctive whistled variety, and how ideas of heritage and linguistic value shape processes of transmission and cultural continuity.</p>
