<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p>
I am a Hungarian PhD candidate in Linguistics at Maynooth University, Ireland. Originally from Budapest and now based in Ireland, my academic work is shaped by an interdisciplinary background in Anthropology and Linguistic Anthropology.
</p>

<p>
My research interests lie at the intersection of minority language communities, linguistic landscape, vocabulary change, language revitalization, language policy, and linguistic human rights. I am particularly interested in dialectal variation and lexical transformation in minoritized language contexts.
</p>

<h2 id="research">Research</h2>

<p><strong>An Ethnography of Gascon Béarnais Occitan: Language Ideology, Cultural Reclamation, and Whistled Practices</strong></p>

<p>
My doctoral research is an ethnographic study of Gascon Béarnais Occitan conducted in Pau and the village of Aas in southern France. The project examines how activists, teachers, institutional actors, and community members engage with both the spoken dialect and its distinctive whistled variety. It explores questions of linguistic value, authenticity, heritage, and revitalization in both official and everyday contexts.
</p>

<p>
The project employs ethnographic fieldwork, combining participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and analysis of linguistic landscape and cultural performance. In addition to contemporary fieldwork, archival research is undertaken to examine historical documentation, institutional records, and earlier representations of Gascon Béarnais Occitan. Drawing on both anthropological and sociolinguistic approaches, the study investigates language ideology as both discourse and lived social practice across historical and contemporary contexts.
</p>

<h2 id="fieldwork">Fieldwork</h2>

<p>
Fieldwork is scheduled to take place in Pau and the Aspe Valley. Preliminary visits have informed the development of research questions, community engagement, and archival orientation.
